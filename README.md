# Micro-Services Day 2 Networking

These are the labs for an Istio based training on day 2 networking.  This is very hands on with more focus on demo and lab time than on slides.  It leverages an micro-services built application which is a react front-end showing vehicle tracking in the UK, multiple services for vehicle similuation.  The application provides an opportunity to work on common networking issues and evaluate the istio suite of services.  The application itself isn't part of the course.
